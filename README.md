# Potts-XY

Plotting iPython notebooks for the Potts-XY project.

## Data

The data files are on .npy and .txt format, and have been extracted from the raw data.

## Prerequisites

You need to download the files

```
funcfssa.py
funcfssa2.py
funcfssa3.py
```

Which provide the function that does the finite size scaling fit (the number represents the added number of finite size corrections to scaling).

## Prerequisites

The following notebooks are present:

```
Energy_Binder_different_delta.ipynb
```

This creates a plot comparing the Energy's Binder cumulant for \Delta = 0.5 , 1.0 and 1.5.
